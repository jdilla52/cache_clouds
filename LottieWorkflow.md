# worklfow for lottie from illustrator. 

In general we're trying to get from an ai illustration to a lottie json which I can push into the web.

1. You first need to install the lottie plugin to ae via creative cloud
   - https://exchange.adobe.com/creativecloud.details.103642.html
2. You need te enable scripts to write files + access your network
   - Preferences/Scripting and Expressions
   - then check box
3. You can then animate your ai files normally in ae.
   - import the ai file... keyframe etc. 
   - the only consideration is after importing the ai layers to shapes

4. When I exported the asset to a local file the asset was incorrect so make sure to check it.
    - create an account with lottie
    - upload the design
      - https://lottiefiles.com/preview
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH0ka3fKQUk
    - check the result is what you're looking for. It will preview differently on devices.
5. Adding design to figma - the figma lottie plugin enables previewing the lottie
   - The plugin has been added to the space but you need to login

   - figma icon/plugins/lottiefiles
   - signin
   - upload design locally
